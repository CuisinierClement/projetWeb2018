Converted as WAR project (http://seedstack.org/getting-started/project-templates/web/)
-- adding a src/main/webapp folder to hold the document root

-- remove the build-capule plugin execution (package goal of seedstack-maven-plugin) as this only works with standalone JAR files
-- configuring the maven-war-plugin to ignore the absence of the web.xml file
